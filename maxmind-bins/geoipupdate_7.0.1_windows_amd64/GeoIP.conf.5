GeoIP.conf - Configuration file for geoipupdate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This file allows you to configure your \f[V]geoipupdate\f[R] program to
download GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The file consists of one setting per line.
Lines starting with \f[V]#\f[R] are comments and will not be processed.
All setting keywords are case sensitive.
.SS Required settings:
.TP
\f[V]AccountID\f[R]
Your MaxMind account ID.
This was formerly known as \f[V]UserId\f[R].
This can be overridden at run time by either the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID\f[R] or the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID_FILE\f[R] environment variables.
.TP
\f[V]LicenseKey\f[R]
Your case-sensitive MaxMind license key.
This can be overridden at run time by either the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY\f[R] or
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY_FILE\f[R] environment variables.
.TP
\f[V]EditionIDs\f[R]
List of space-separated database edition IDs.
Edition IDs may consist of letters, digits, and dashes.
For example, \f[V]GeoIP2-City\f[R] would download the GeoIP2 City
database (\f[V]GeoIP2-City\f[R]).
This can be overridden at run time by the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_EDITION_IDS\f[R] environment variable.
Note: this was formerly called \f[V]ProductIds\f[R].
.SS Optional settings:
.TP
\f[V]DatabaseDirectory\f[R]
The directory to store the database files.
If not set, the default is
%SystemDrive%ProgramDataMaxMindGeoIPUpdateGeoIP.
This can be overridden at run time by the \f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_DB_DIR\f[R]
environment variable or the \f[V]-d\f[R] command line argument.
.TP
\f[V]Host\f[R]
The host name of the server to use.
The default is \f[V]updates.maxmind.com\f[R].
This can be overridden at run time by the \f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_HOST\f[R]
environment variable.
.TP
\f[V]Proxy\f[R]
The proxy host name or IP address.
You may optionally specify a port number, e.g.,
\f[V]127.0.0.1:8888\f[R].
If no port number is specified, 1080 will be used.
This can be overridden at run time by the \f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_PROXY\f[R]
environment variable.
.TP
\f[V]ProxyUserPassword\f[R]
The proxy user name and password, separated by a colon.
For instance, \f[V]username:password\f[R].
This can be overridden at run time by the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_PROXY_USER_PASSWORD\f[R] environment variable.
.TP
\f[V]PreserveFileTimes\f[R]
Whether to preserve modification times of files downloaded from the
server.
This option is either \f[V]0\f[R] or \f[V]1\f[R].
The default is \f[V]0\f[R].
This can be overridden at run time by the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_PRESERVE_FILE_TIMES\f[R] environment variable.
.TP
\f[V]LockFile\f[R]
The lock file to use.
This ensures only one \f[V]geoipupdate\f[R] process can run at a time.
Note: Once created, this lockfile is not removed from the filesystem.
The default is \f[V].geoipupdate.lock\f[R] under the
\f[V]DatabaseDirectory\f[R].
This can be overridden at run time by the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_LOCK_FILE\f[R] environment variable.
.TP
\f[V]RetryFor\f[R]
The amount of time to retry for when errors during HTTP transactions are
encountered.
It can be specified as a (possibly fractional) decimal number followed
by a unit suffix.
Valid time units are \f[V]ns\f[R], \f[V]us\f[R] (or \f[V]\[mc]s\f[R]),
\f[V]ms\f[R], \f[V]s\f[R], \f[V]m\f[R], \f[V]h\f[R].
The default is \f[V]5m\f[R] (5 minutes).
This can be overridden at run time by the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_RETRY_FOR\f[R] environment variable.
.TP
\f[V]Parallelism\f[R]
The maximum number of parallel database downloads.
The default is 1, which means that databases will be downloaded
sequentially.
This can be overridden at run time by the
\f[V]GEOIPUPDATE_PARALLELISM\f[R] environment variable or the
\f[V]--parallelism\f[R] command line argument.
